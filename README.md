# kelefstis
Extensible Kubernetes compliance check tool

This is an example how to connect to a K8S master from Go using the client api.

A template is used to create a basic report checking some compliance rules.

The name [Kelestis is Greek](https://en.bab.la/dictionary/english-greek/boatswain) for [Boatswain](http://work.chron.com/duties-boatswain-20927.html), who has the [maintenance role on a ship](http://www.thepirateking.com/historical/ship_roles.htm)

To be tested, there must be a running Kubernetes cluster configured in `.kube/config`

Please extend!

Tests will follow! I promise!

Install it with all deps by `go get -u github.com/endocode/kelefstis`, this will take some time fetching all dependencies.
